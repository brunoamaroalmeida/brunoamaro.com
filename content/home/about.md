I work as Head of Technology & Architecture at Fortum [Fortum](https://www.fortum.com) and regularly advise and help  organisations with technology and digital transformation.

Based in Helsinki, I work in areas such as *Cloud*, *DevOps*, *Security*, *IoT*, *Data Engineering* & *AI*.

Throughout me career I worked in a wide range of positions from senior management to deep technical roles.

I am passionate about *culture* and *digital transformation* and have been involved in several projects from both the human (**Leadership**, **Coaching**, **Mentoring**) and technical (**Cloud**, **Security**, **DevOps**, **AI**) perspective.

For freelance work, I founded [exce.pt](https://exce.pt). Reach out if you want to hire me for services such as coaching, speaking, architecture, training, advisory or other type of contract work.
